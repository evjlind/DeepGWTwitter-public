Another century in the offing for Root 😓

Never listen to Siraj for a review how have we not learnt that

Glad Rohit was finally able to convert that start into a solid 80 odd. Should give him a lot of confidence going forward
PSG's media team is light years ahead of Barca. They're doing justice to the goat with so much content
Time we move past Pujara, especially in England
@IndianHesson Rohit ne tera tweet dil pe le liya
How has he lost the toss again ffs 
@IndianHesson At home when we don't need it lol
Please kohli win this one toss at least
He's not even top 25, please stop embarrassing yourself 
@progress2trees @IrishHonkey55 Yeah you wouldn't know
That was one of the worst penalties I've ever seen. Hit it close to the keeper, at a good height for him to save and no power on it.
@IrishHonkey55 Americans 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
36°C ffs why is DC intent on killing us
@m_r_martineau It's annoying
PSG have given us more Messi content in 12 hours than Barca did in the last year
Bigger entourage than a head of state 
Alba without Messi is just @clmatino. Short, agile and clueless on the ball
PSG's promotion videos have been class
Messi got senators tweeting about him too. Gargantuan influence 
Can't believe I just looked up PSG's schedule 🤢🤢
@benjonescricket So Moeen comes in for a batsman(Lawrence?)
😭😭😭 
I miss David Gower on comms 
@IrishHonkey55 You
Gosh it's going to feel so odd to see Messi in any other club's jersey
Good. 
Watching Messi play at the Camp Nou was at the top of my bucket list. Was convinced I'd go and watch him there before he retires 😔
@cric_analytics Don't doubt that one bit.
@clmatino Me praying for pep to rotate him 
@clmatino No way 💀💀
We really didn't give the greatest player of all time, who dedicated all his life to this club, a proper farewell. Disgraceful
The schedule in general is so incredibly packed that having a reserve day is hard. Probably could do it between the… 
102 jeez baseball is fucking crazy 
@dweplea Hmm I've heard it too but not even close to how much I've seen it on twitter
@dweplea I think a lot of it is just twitter. Not that many people genuinely think like that in real life
Don't think we'll win if there's only 45-50 overs of play, need closer to 60 for that.
Spurs fan 💀💀 
@VedantGedelaa Makes sense to be nervous, we aren't great chasing but the pitch  does seemed to have eased out and… 
@m_r_martineau Brit's "traditional" food is actually criminal
Excellent finish to the day. Made use of the pitch easing out and scored at a good rate
KL in full flow 🥰
@IndianHesson 😭😭
What else is there to be said about Bumrah! Far too good
@IndianHesson No balls lol
@IndianHesson What were those 2 balls to Robinson tho, that annoyed me more
Needed Ishant for greater control here
Awful over by Shami, can't be wasting the new ball like that
Really important phase, game could get away from us very quickly if we don't utilise the new ball.
If Root and Curran are still batting when we take the new ball then they will cash in and we might be looking at a…

@dweplea Willow usually has replays, I find that very useful (for test cricket at least)
@cric_analytics There were multiple rain delays, some lengthier than others so I don't think it's that much of an issue
Not a great start from India. Time to get Shami on
@faisal337_ @IndianHesson Led by 53 I think
@elitecynic Kl scored 90 in the first innings then, 84 now 😳
England getting a taste of their own medicine ahhh
State of our senior batsmen 😬 
Shami's batting is too funny 😭
@IndianHesson Caught at long on or deep mid trying a six 😭
@BerbaSpinCric Fair enough but England were also unlucky to go off the field when they were on top yesterday
This was less than 24 hours before Barca announced he was leaving. How can something change so drastically in less… 
Incredible 6 mins. Gone from 2-0 down to 3-2 up!
😔😔 
@clmatino You didn't have to do me like that
I'm really gonna have to buy a subscription specifically for the Uber eats league and tune in every week just to watch Messi play 😭
 
😭😭😭 
I will have to sell my soul to the devil and start supporting PSG if Messi goes there 😭
@clmatino Don't have money to pay for some decent signings and now they want messi dfkm 😭
I am about to throw up what the actual fuck 
I took a nap for 2 hrs and suddenly Messi is leaving???
How do you keep coming off after bowling 1-2 balls, I hate UK weather so much
I refuse to believe the UK is a real country

Sreejesh has always been indian hockey's king. So glad to see him get all the adulation that he deserves
@elitecynic This test match is obviously still far from over, although this England is nowhere near that India.
@clmatino Yes, I did! 
@clmatino Let's be honest you'd be down worse
United fans somehow always manage to outdo themselves 
@benjonescricket @CricViz How shocked were you to see the XI's and do you agree with them?
@BhatiaGus I do not trust a place named delhi dhaba when it comes to dosa but I will go with you
I actually dreamt about eating dosa, that's how much I miss it 😭
They're not making the openers play enough
Bumrah far too good! Never count a champion out
Sam Curran I love you but please get out
Lord Shardul 🙏🙏🙏
Brilliant ny india, been relentless post tea
@IndianHesson I hope he wasn't dropped
@IndianHesson Ishant is injured?
It really is as simple as that 
 
India have conceded far too many penalty corners and it has come back to haunt us
@VedantGedelaa Heard it was a great game. Shame I missed it
@IrishHonkey55 Talking about hockey 😭
Field hockey is incredibly fun to watch
Never been so tense while watching a game, what an amazing performance from our women 😭❤️ 
India women, what a performance 😭😭

@fratboyjaden Bro he cut it with a piece of glass he’s a thief not a barber
Can’t wait for the school year to start so I can finally delete gw Twitter
@luviwol That’s on you
I’m too good at sounding stupid people cannot tell when I’m joking
@Brandripping @ReCastle2 @SHINI741 @alexgmurd A coitus correspondence
@SHINI741 @alexgmurd A copulation conversation
this aged splendidly! She and I are now friends and we’re gonna start an anime together (plus she’s so pretty) 
@jayrscotty No cap on jah you spitting fax
Ok guys I just got ordained to marry people so if anyone wants to get married. To me. For fafsa. It can be done.
@alexgmurd We call it intercourse discourse
@sakuraswaifu both! Mostly the former tho
I… I don’t see any difference in the Twitter font
@sakuraswaifu Hi babe I love you more than you may ever comprehend &amp; I’m here for you
@sakuraswaifu Ty queen
@sakuraswaifu don’t you headcanon me gay 🤨
I want to gatekeep stone ocean so bad 
@OneFeIISwoop no freakin way

@666ofswords @lizxvan I want those rings sm
@sakuraswaifu Yea basically
@sakuraswaifu It’s… unsurprising
@sakuraswaifu This is… a very in-character assortment of tabs
@TherapistMitski this is awkward

@ElliottSchoolGW this is for your students 😐 
@franksonetra You have to understand. I don’t HAVE that pain. I lack such… weaknesses.
I’m never not gonna do this
 
@franksonetra Correction: YOUR back and shoulders are no match. I’m fine.
@sakuraswaifu Thank you ily

@lilthonkoou Because my brain functions from time to time
@slimegoblinn Well to be fair all your tweets are bangers
I watched the first episode of what if. Carter is a menace and I love her

@CourtneyKushnir No but like same  I need my friends’ parents to love me
@mo_rafter @TessKlugewicz I’m just looking out for her financial aid (and I wanna marry her)
@TessKlugewicz Get married to ME
And then you’re like a lil sad
And then you tweet something totally random and it gets a relatively high amount of likes and sometimes even interactions
Does anyone else get insecure when they tweet something that they put some level of thought into and no one likes it
Aw heck now the ‘25 freshmen like me and want them to join their Lil gc

Other oomf who owns this account does not bully coomf who tweeted this for being the same height as Dora

@JuanMoraCal “sports teams move locations all the time” explain the Euros to me please
Ah yes because fans of the Italian national team (and Italian football in general) are famously un-terrible 
This is the most evil piece of writing I’ve ever seen 
This joke is more applicable to Russian Circles I think but I did actually fall asleep listening to GY!BE last night
Can’t tell if I was woken up by a lawnmower or if I fell asleep listening to Godspeed You! Black Emperor again

The fact that the name “Ben Kane Student Center” failed is an example of liberal cancel culture 
No Ndombele no chance

@RyanJGilbertson yep lol
@PeanutDweck the all important question
my coach asking me if that 65 yard cross field upwind blade was the right decision 
I love football but sometimes the fans aren’t the brightest 
@PeanutDweck yeah 🙃
@PeanutDweck 
Maya Wiley holding a Havdalah service in broad daylight doesn’t really sit right with me
We should stop allowing 16 year olds on Twitter 
Denmark losing 2 games and advancing to the Round of 16 is why football is called The Beautiful Game
@cjtweetsalot thought that was Josh Sargent for a sec
Would just “lol” be sufficient
Trying to think of something clever to tweet about Ben Simmons
@PeanutDweck I mean, it seemed like a legit enough question considering Kosher =\= glatt =\= beit yosef
@PeanutDweck Kosher but most of the kosher availability around me also happens to be glatt
@PeanutDweck Nothing compares to hasgacha/hechscher discourse
Twitter may be toxic but it is nowhere near the level of Facebook groups dedicated to Kosher restaurants

@nktvsk Feel like I keep bringing this topic back up again lol, but this statbasicalysums up my frustration

@nktvsk But, certainly, at least we're not the Knicks, haha 😆

@nktvsk It will be entertaining for sure, but if your goal is to one day win a championship, it doesn't do anything… 
@nktvsk I wish. At least Paul Pierce won the Wizards a playoff game. I don't see it happening with Westbrook. I hope I'm wrong
@nktvsk I literally quit. I can no longer be a Wizards fan. This is just idiotic
@nktvsk Clearly a great time happened
The article to read on the Fakhrizadeh assassination 
@JustinDiamondHQ But, of course, I assume the radical centrists are the smartest of them all
@nktvsk Yeah, this happens every couple of years and it never works out well for the teams, but I guess people just…

@JustinDiamondHQ @megasofer Hear me out. I really think we should just yeet this couch over the metro turnstiles

@JustinDiamondHQ @megasofer It's on Fox News. They probably just found one random tweet and based it on that lol
@PatrickJBurland This type of slander will not be allowed 
Praise the Lord! One of the biggest reasons I'm celebrating 
@AlanLCross I get that, but Trump doesn't scream faith and family values to me, but apparently he does to some people
@barbaraslavin1 They said they will not release any more vote counts in Nevada for another 24 hours. Their reason for that is unclear
@JohnFea1 Well, it's certainly sounding like Trump is trying to steal the election, but I have a feeling he's not referring to that
@CrawfordStuff @nytimes @Nate_Cohn A tad bit confusing graphic to be sure though.

"He (Kim Jong-Un) didn't like Obama."   I miss the days when our President didn't care about brutal dictators liking him.
While he's more calm and is interrupting less, this is key 
@JustinDiamondHQ I'd say Biden's doing significantly better too though. The new rules certainly have made it more watchable at least.
@nktvsk @JustinDiamondHQ has finally met his match 😆
@JustinDiamondHQ @nktvsk I think you'd appreciate this tweet though @JustinDiamondHQ

This should terrify everyone. PERIOD. 
@nktvsk I'm crying 😂
Every other sentence from Trump is a dog whistle. The blatant racism is nauseating.

@simusa2 Bhai tu shoutout deke thak nahi gaya
Siraj is now my favourite player. By far. So much to love about him
Not been this happy in a long long time
It worked omg 
Joe Root get out challenge
That's the same way Burns got out to Cummins in the Ashes too. He closes that bat face too early
💀💀💀 
Bruh get on with it why are we wasting time 🤦🏾‍♂️
@neherrrr I'm rubbing my eyes in disbelief 😭😭 this has been brilliant haha
Please declare!!! We have enough 
Hahaha I fucking love Shami
Time to declare. 
Ahh 50 run partnership, these two batting like a dream 🥰
That Shami forward defence is the best in the business btw
No way a couple of short balls to Anderson have riled up the entire English team lmao
Haha kohli saying Bhenchod in the balcony after Bumrah hits a four
50 more runs and we're in business but I honestly don't see us getting that many
@clmatino Bro when I see you it's on sight.
@clmatino At least we had the best player of all time play for us.
@clmatino What's the history of spurs? Oh wait there's none 🤭
@CricketHonestly Ah well I tend to keep him out of discussions, no one like him. Rohit just ought to be careful that's it
@CricketHonestly Frustrating when it happens again and again. He knows field is set for it, all England have to do… 
As soon I saw this I knew that terrorist @clmatino has retweeted it 
Rohit needs to be talked to, this isn't limited overs cricket bhai, gandu shot khel ke out hona is not acceptable
Rahane gone just before the new ball, feels like game over 😔
He was. 
Nick knight is such an elite commentator. 100% agree with him on the fast bowlers not diving bit
@VedantGedelaa Not at all. We have a long tail, basically 4 number 11s. That's the worry
Hmmm winviz says india is ahead but doesn't feel like that at all
Brilliant fifty from Rahane, desperately need him to kick on
We are in so much trouble, I knew this would happen 😭😭 
Why is our worst bowler this innings bowling to the tail right now instead of Bumrah?
Imagine not being impressed by Siraj in this innings. He's been very very good 
@VedantGedelaa Second innings is where Shami fucked up last test. It's not good enough to wait for someone to turn up in only one innings
Another mediocre bowling performance by Shami. Two innings in a row now where he's conceded over 4 runs an over
