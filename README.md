# DeepGWtwitter
This repository contains all of the code for the GPT-3 iteration of the @botgwu twitter account run by me. This project is meant as a lighthearted look into whatever GW Twitter is and tries to emulate it using one of the most advanced machine learning algorithms that currently exist. Some might say this is a waste of computing resources and they are absolutely correct. Certain things are omitted from the public release of this code such as my API keys to make sure that my costs stay low and my accounts don't get banned from the various services I am using. Other things omitted are twitter user ids and usernames from the tweets themselves. The full file of tweets that the bot is based off of is available but I wouldn't reccomend looking through it. All of it was public at the time it was pulled from twitter. Please contact me at evanjlindeman@gwu.edu if you have any questions or concerns about the bot!
